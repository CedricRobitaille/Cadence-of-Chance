# A Cadence of Chance

**A Cadence of Change** is a deckbuilding roguelike built around the mechanics of a slot machine. Instead of purely relying on chance, players assemble a deck of enhancements that influence spins, payouts, and the overall flow of the game.

The goal is simple: spin the wheel, get rich, and build a deck strong enough to survive increasingly difficult stages. Along the way, you'll need to balance your money, optimize your deck, and make tough choices on when to play it safe, or when to go all-in.

While the slot machine is unpredictable, the real strategy comes from how you build your deck. Each run is differnt, and success depends on how well you adapt your deck to shift the odds back in your favor.
